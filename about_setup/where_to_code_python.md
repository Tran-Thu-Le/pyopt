# Where to code Python?

There are many platforms that you can code Python.

## 1. For beginner

Use online platforms: [Google Colab][gc] (12 GB RAM available) or [Jupyter org][jup] (2GB RAM available).

- Pros:

  - **Run code online**
  - Good for education, sharing and collaboration
  - Pre-Installed packages, file saved online

- Cons:

  - Google colab has no terminal (hard to use)

## 2. For intermediate

Use IDE platforms: Jupyter Notebook.

Here IDE means Integrated Development Environment.
To install Jupyter Notebook, it is recommended to install [Anaconda][ana],
which includes Jupyter Notebook as a sub-application.

[ana]: https://www.anaconda.com/

- Pros:
  - Many pre-installed packages (numpy for matrix-vector calculations, matplotlib for plotting, ...)
- Cons:
  - Unnecessary packages and software are also installed

## 3. For expert

Use text editors: [VScode][vscode]

- Pros:

  - A lot of flexibility (shortcuts, snippets) and many plugins

- Cons:
  - Need advanced concepts (terminal, modules, git, virtualenv, ...)
